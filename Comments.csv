Wow. It's so a beautiful song ❤
"Starting is like-intensely  sobbing narration  presented by a guy who studied all upon his feet while academics but left with no job and he's cursing that time now! 
Then it would be like:

My lungs are black cuz I smoke a tons of pack,
 my heart is pure ,but it works no more
My hands are scarred from nights before the exam
And my hair is thin and falling out
 of all the wrong places ,

I am a little insecure, would I ever be approached 
O these  under eyes circle, now I look like a ghost
I bite my nails under anxiety 
and tell the truth that's little messy

I go from thin to overweight
, day to day it fluctuates

My skin is inked, but faded, too
I'm hell burnt out product of only pages now!"
Ed Sheeran
❤️ https://youtu.be/WJJVMAQ9Rl0
"😍😍😍😍😵😭😭

💙
Another one! An Ed Sheeran classic!
"You are AWESOME,  I LOVE YOU"
🤦👎
I've missed his ballads like this
This reminds me so much of ‘wake me up’ which is one of my favourite songs.
Broke the replay button💕
This should be with bieber
Just here to listen ur voice
"Ed goes back to his + and x days





Me: Wait thats illegal"
So beautiful
This is the classic EdSheeran we all know💙

Now THIS is the Ed Sheeran that we know
Did Ed Sheeran have started watching BTS MV songs and got inspired
"Me : I'm gonna play Ed's 'Perfect ' at my wedding day .

Ed Sheeren : Hold my guitar"
Finally 💜💜💜
This song feels like a huge throwback to old times. What a great feeling!
"Ed sheeran like 
Khalid comment"
Finally the music that won't hurt my ear
I feel like every song ed releases relates who he is. Like he can sing all his insecurities in his songs and remind everyone that popular or not some parts of us are just the same.
Old Ed Sheeran is back
I love your voice
"Who's Before million of view's ?

"ED- She can have anyone else

"""Best Part Of Me"" Lyrics
(feat. YEBBA)

My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thinnin', falling out
Of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure

My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight
Oh day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me ,how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
(With you)

Baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

Baby, I'm so in love with you, yeah, yeah
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you"
The people that disliked this had their phones upside down 😒😒
"I like Ed's quiet songs, they go so deep. Beautiful !"
Reminds me of my ex who I love deeply 😘😘
Omg is anyone else crying?? I love Ed Sheeran so much❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"This made my mind at ease after hearing blow.  I love the ballad side of him. Also how he steps up more out of his comfort zone. This new album is full of surprises indeed,  and I love him for that. He can do all."

I am a little insecure

Wow🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤣🤣🤣🤣🧐
"Ed, you're a really great singer.Beautiful People was a critique of fame and reputation.Some people did not like the new album, but I think Ed again showed us the quality music.And it's a great thing to do with legendary singers.Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran are my favorite singers."
"I'll collect all of the stars . I'd dive in tenerife ocean to collect star dusts and put them all in your photograph beside  supermarket flowers and into my soul. I'd built you a castle on a hill or a lego house , your childhood runaway place. Girl, you're not beautiful people but you are perfect for my universe. Tell me, will that make you happier ? . Tell me how would you feel ?. I don't care about that now. You know why? Because you love the best part of me . kiss me now. Let's make it rain ."
"This is by far the best of the singles released from this album so far.....I Don't Care is catchy but mediocre, personally I can't stand Cross Me or Beautiful People, I've only listened to Blow once but it ain't my thing...... but this is truly beautiful. I played it at work this morning to my colleague and she cried, hope there's more like this on the album! Just my opinion 🎸👌"
Ok this is my new favourite of the album...
ED SHEERAN COLAB WITH LABRINTH PLEASEEEEEEEEE 💛💛💛
I am so in love with you! 😍😜
😍😍
Just when I started to think I needed more slow ed sheeran songs.......
After Blow ft. Bruno Mars and Chris Stapleton?

"""Best Part Of Me""
(feat. YEBBA)

My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thinnin', falling out
Of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure

My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight
Oh day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me ,how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
(With you)

Baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

Baby, I'm so in love with you, yeah, yeah
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you"

My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thinnin', falling out
Of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure

My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight
Oh day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me ,how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
(With you)

Baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

I love it. It reminds me s.th special.
Now THIS is Ed's next BIG SONG!
❤️
"Me: I want to forget my ex and move on
Ed Sheeran : we dont do that here"
the fact that Ed got Yebba on his album and this song shows how big of a deal she is and SHOULD BE! she’s so so underrated but her voice is so diverse so it’s so fitting for this song. absolutely beautiful🥺
Baby I'm so in love with you 😍
"Why the hell do u love me, cause I dont even love myself.


i cri."
"What 471k like what

YOU KNOW WHY SHE LOVES YOU now Ed...that's obviously dude !"
"Love this so much ! if someone see this, i'm a french producer and i dream to work with ed... if you got 1 minute to listen my music i'm the happiest today !"

"these type of songs is what makes ed “ed"""
The best part of the song is “It made me sad for no cause” 💕
I don't know how Ed gets to describe everything we want and feel in one song❤️ It's like we have our own compositor.
Omg🙌🙌🙌 (let's pretend that I commented something funny)
"When you love to sing it but you dont want to murder good songs, okay lets just listen"
"an upbeat pop song (I don't care), HipHop & R&B rhythms (Cross me & Beautiful People), a rock song (Blow) and now an acoustic melody.... the balance of genres in Ed Sheeran's new album is better than the balance in Star Wars universe"
Omg! How amazing this song is! I just love it so much ❤️... Ed Sheeran!is the the best 🌟 as I already told you this year 2019 is yours!! Come on  I am waiting for a lot more...
Best part of me is that i listen  your songs 👌👌❤

And lately everything's making sense too💙😍
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you. 😍❤️"
It Sound Good❣️

                 Art"
yebba finally getting that dough
"Uhm kind of a shame YEBBA couldn't do this in her lower, sexier, more sultry register. The distinct and original sound of her voice is lost."
OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
"This is typical ed sheeran song 
Likeb if u agree lol😂"
🤩 Best part of Me is You 🤩

Goosebumps on chorus
"My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

Baby, the best part of me is you (Whoa)
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Costs just a like😉"
"1:58 Wait, did the official lyric video get the lyrics wrong? Isn't it ""still forget""  instead of ""forgive""? Would make way more sense, too."
This is Amazing 🥺💙
😌♥️🌙
"How much of a throwback ED vibe do you want ?
ED : YES"
"Best part of ed Sheeran is his perfect. An emotional song writer, Who always makes his fans to know lyrics. I don't know how but after every release of his song I usually se the lyrics first."
I love that whenever Ed releases a new song and I come to listen on YouTube I don’t even have to listen to the song to like it bc I know it’s going to be amazing.
After Long time got back original ed shreen song.

"So every wedding should have a playlist called ""Ed Sheeran Greatest Hits"""
The best part of the song 0:01-4:03

So good 👍
when ed sheeran said “why the hell do you love me because i don’t even love myself” i felt that
"Yea...I never understood how some people love others :O ,lately a girl told me this...that she likes me more than friends,and I'm the best thing happen to her,and now..I hate myself because I don't feel the same, she is great."
"I want Ed to sit next to me and explain all the reasons why my ex left me even when I loved her the most, in a song."
Ed Sheeran is one of my favourites I really hope to work with him one day. Listen to one of my songs if you got like a minute you'd be surprised!
I was so scared that Ed was going to stop writing beautiful music like the music on his divide album then I heard this and realized that he still has it in him. We love you Ed! You are amazing.
"Nice,  i like ❤"
i don’t know why this song reminds me of Best of me by BTS and BTS
The best part of me is youu 🖤🖤🖤🖤
I will release my cover later. I dont care if someone will tell me that they dont like my voice. But I know Miracles do come true. God bless everyone. Thank you Ed! #Philippines

"Lyrics 


Ed Sheeran
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too


Ed Sheeran
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself


Ed Sheeran with YEBBA
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you


YEBBA
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet


YEBBA
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself


Ed Sheeran & YEBBA
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you


EBBA
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum


Both, Ed Sheeran, & YEBBA
Baby, the best part of me is you (Whoa)
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you"
my heart felt the song
"I LOVE ED LOVE SONGS SO MUCH


IT HELPS ME TO SEE LOVE IN A DEFERENT WAY."

This is my song when I fall into disuse. By the way hola obsessivity ( I bite my nail.. 😅)
"I absolutely love it! The worst part of the song was that it ended...The collab was an amazing idea! So many people will be using your songs on their wedding day! Cant wait for the pop up stores to come to us and cant wait for Project No.6 to be finished. Well...i actually dont want it to be finished because your making amazing music! And in the end, if you ask what was our favourite. I will not asnwer 😂 I love all."

Just wanted to mess with lyrics!"
"Dude, just listened to Blow that just dropped. Now this, completely opposite songs. Blow was like the pick up line, this song is the wedding song. I'm here for ALL OF IT!!!"
"Yebba needs to release an album already and I truly hope it's nowhere close to what she was like in this song. 
Yes the song is cute and all but Yebba is insanely vocally talented and everytime I see she's done a collab recently, it leaves something to be desired. She needs to focus on trying not to produce music for the masses and make music from the heart ALA her ""my mind"" performance from SOLAR."

"[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran with YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet


[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA]
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & YEBBA]
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge: YEBBA]
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

[Chorus: Both, Ed Sheeran, & YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you (Whoa)
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you"
💖💖💖
Liquid gold...
"""My lungs are Black""
You need a Doctor, Brother."

Yebba is one of the greatest singers of this time and is so underrated. I’m so happy Ed decided to collab with her
This song makes me thinking of my ex girlfriend. Kinda makes me sad. I hope someday when I‘ve found a new one I can return to this awesome song and listen to it in peace.
"This man knows how to make people feel. Whenever i am having a bad day, I come to his songs and it lifts up my mood. Ed is more than we deserve 🖤"

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before

My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me

Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?

Baby, the best part of me is you

Ed Sheeran you are my favorite 🎶

Ed should have singing this on his own. Yebba trying to hard to sound melismatic it ruins this charming song. She needs to calm down.
"This sounds a little like throwback ed sheeran, and I absolutely love it!!💛

"Oh, the best part of this song is when they sing"
I’m here because I saw YEBBA!
"Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out at all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA]
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & YEBBA]
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge: YEBBA]
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

[Chorus: Both, Ed Sheeran, & YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, I'm so in love with you"
I m glad that you are my favorite singer ❤️❤️
YEBBA 😭😭😭
Ohhhhhhhhhhh this is Perfect
"Yaaaassss!! Ed Sheeran keep 'em songs coming.  Been a fan of yours since i was 9 years old. Now i'm 19!!

The Yebba's voice Is the definition of art
"Lyrics:


My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out at all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, I fluctuate
My skin is inked, but faded, too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she loves me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bits
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

Baby, the best part of me is you 
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you 
Baby, I'm so in love with you 
Baby, I'm so in love with you"
It seems that even if he wanted he couldn’t write a bad song
the balance of genres in Ed Sheeran's new album is better than the balance in Star Wars universe
"This needed just 1 second to know it will sound awesome. It's so written true, the lyrics are so beautiful. And aw Yebba I love your  voice  and tg it's a joy to listen to. The Video is amazing and simple beautiful. Awesome song, my new fav. ❤️"

I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, I fluctuate
My skin is inked, but faded, too

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she loves me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bits
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA]
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & YEBBA]
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge: YEBBA]
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

[Chorus: Both, Ed Sheeran, & YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, I'm so in love with you"

😢😢
"This is so beautiful in every human way. It reminds me so much of my relationship with my boyfriend. He told me I’m his goddess, I’m his sunshine, and he loves me. I don’t even believe those words before because how can someone like him who’s just perfect can actually love someone like me who’s a mess? I don’t even love myself before. But he’s patient. So patient and so understanding, I still don’t know how to deserve him. Because everytime he tells me I’m beautiful, I can only marvel at those words knowing that he’s the most beautiful human in this world. Everytime he tells me I’m his sunshine, I can only stare at the light he illuminates because he’s the light himself. I will never be able to deserve him. But I will try everything I can do and I have to make him the happiest because he makes me so happy. 

Thank you so much for this, Ed. One day, when me and him will be able to get past this difficult situation we’re currently in, hopefully, this song can be one of the songs I’ll dance with him on our wedding day. ❤️💖"

"Ed Sheeran inspired me to write songs. I love how he use the simplest words and still hit the deepest part of the listener's heart.

I'm writing a song right now and I got to start it with:

""Would you let me cry
Cause right now I feel alone
But with you by my side
Solitude is just a tone"""
brenda

"This song reminds me how loved i am with my wife right now. She accepts me for who i am. My mistakes, pain, insecurities, fear and many more. 

I became a father as early as 17 years old and our age gap is 7 years.

We've been through many things, and she still by my side. Even if i try to push her away. Still she believes in me. She believes that one day ill be a better person. 

And thats who i am today. 
Forever, ""The best part of me is YOU ""

Thank you for loving me Rechiel. <3 <3 8 years and counting"

My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thinnin', falling out
Of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure

My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight
Oh day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me ,how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
(With you)

Baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too

"After being ever so slightly disillusioned by Ed’s first rock song (that I’ve heard) I absolutely fell in love with this simple, honest, amazing love song. Listening to this a third time I was imagining the acoustic solo version where he sings the 2nd verse from his point of view with ‘I’m so in love with you’ building with his loop pedal at the end. I can’t wait!"
shape of song😊😊

"[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out at all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, I fluctuate
My skin is inked, but faded, too

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she loves me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bits
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA]
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & YEBBA]
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge: YEBBA]
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

[Chorus: Both, Ed Sheeran, & YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, I'm so in love with you"

What am i supposed to do when the best part of me was always you?
I'm so happy to hear this collaboration! They're both have deliciously melodic voices. I fall into Ed's lyrics and wrap myself up with his music ❤
"I'm asking my boyfriend to marry me this year. We both share a love for music, we sing karaoke together. I always knew my boyfriend liked me before we were dating, because everyday he would sing Your Song by Elton John to me and we would always sing Islands in the Stream by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers. He still sings Your Song to me and he also sings the song Amazed by Lonestar to me. I always sing I Got You Babe by Cher and Sonny to him. I want to ask him to marry me with a song. I've been stuck between 2 songs which were Marry me by Train and Hesitate by Jonas Brothers. Now, I found this song and I think This is the one I will ask him with."

"My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thinnin', falling out
Of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure

My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight
Oh day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too

But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me ,how to love myself

'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
(With you)

Baby, the best part of me is you, woah
Lately everything's making sense too
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you

Baby, I'm so in love with you, yeah, yeah
Oh baby, I'm so in love with you"

"Ed creates music that is book soundtrack worthy, he makes you reminisce about a memory you never had."
"Ed has a talent of expressing feelings of heart on his music!❤

I goddamn love it"
"[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out at all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, I fluctuate
My skin is inked, but faded, too

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she loves me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bits
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA]
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & YEBBA]
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge: YEBBA]
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

[Chorus: Both, Ed Sheeran, & YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, I'm so in love with you"
